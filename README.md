# golang-discovery

rust-lang/rustlings, but with `a few modifications :)`

Doing simple things when my mind is tired :P. Maybe this repository will become a place I can use to explore various libraries.

_Tested on Linux. Does not run on Windows._

## Run

```bash
cargo run -- --help
cargo run -- file FILENAME # run specific file
cargo run -- dir FOLDERNAME # run files inside a folder
cargo run -- --all # run all files
```
